Hi all! Welcome to my website hosted on Github. 

My name is Matheus Dalsente Krause and I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Plant Breeding with a Statistics minor at Iowa State University. I am still building this website, and in summary, I will be posting recent research Iâ€™ve been working with, some talks and lectures, and R programming tips focused on plant breeding & quantitative genetics. 

If you are interested in my academic publications, please check my *[Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SFA-axUAAAAJ&hl=en)*. In addition, codes from publications are available on my [Github](https://github.com/mdkrause).

For additional information, my CV can be downloaded **[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdkrause/cvLatex/main/mdkrause_cv_openfont.pdf)**.

Feel free to get in touch on any of my social media!
