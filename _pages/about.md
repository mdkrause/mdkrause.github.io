Hi all! Welcome to my website hosted on Github. 

My name is Matheus Dalsente Krause and I am a Ph.D. Student in Plant Breeding with Statistics minor at Iowa State University. I am still learning how to build it... but in summary, I will be posting recent research Iâ€™ve been working with, some talks and lectures, and R programming tips focused on plant breeding & quantitative genetics.

My CV can be viewed **[here](https://github.com/mdkrause/cvLatex/blob/main/mdkrause-cv.pdf)**.
