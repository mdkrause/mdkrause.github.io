Hi all! Welcome to my website hosted on Github. 

My name is Matheus Dalsente Krause and I am a Ph.D. Student in Plant Breeding with Statistics minor at Iowa State University. I am still learning how to build this website... but in summary, I will be posting recent research Iâ€™ve been working with, some talks and lectures, and R programming tips focused on plant breeding & quantitative genetics.

If you are interested in checking my academic publications, please click on *Google Scholar* on the left. My CV can be viewed **[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdkrause/cvLatex/main/mdkrause-cv.pdf)**.

Feel free to get in touch on any of my social media. Don't be shy! =)
