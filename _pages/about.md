Hi all! Welcome to my website hosted on Github. 

My name is Matheus Dalsente Krause and I am a Ph.D. Student in Plant Breeding with Statistics minor at Iowa State University. I am still learning how to build this website... but in summary, I will be posting recent research Iâ€™ve been working with, some talks and lectures, and R programming tips focused on plant breeding & quantitative genetics.

If you are interested in my academic publications, please check my *[Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SFA-axUAAAAJ&hl=en)*. My CV can be viewed **[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdkrause/cvLatex/main/mdkrause_cv_openfont.pdf)**.

Feel free to get in touch on any of my social media. Don't be shy! =)
