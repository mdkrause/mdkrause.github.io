I was invited by Dr.LÃ¼bberstedt (AGRON 523) to give a short lecture on Simulations in Plant Breeding. I focused on basic simulation theory and explained how the R package AlphaSimR works. The slides can be downloaded *[here](https://github.com/mdkrause/mdkrause.github.io/blob/master/files/AlphaSimR_2022.pdf)*, and the recording is posted below.
